## About

In Platform Game, you take on the role of the Jumper, a thing cursed to an
existence of perpetual escape.  The Jumper is constantly moving forward to
escape the certain doom that follows it, but the path forward is not an easy one.
Help the Jumper prolong the inevitable by using the spacebar, which causes the
Jumper to jump, allowing you to narrowly avoid obstacles and the many forms of
death the Jumper faces.  Life is short for the Jumper, so be sure to live it up
by collecting all the treasures you can.
